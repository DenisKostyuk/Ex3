## ***Ex3 - Directed Weighted Graph on Python***

Hello and wellcome !

This project implementes a directed weighted graph using python language .

Directed weighted graph is a graph which has directed edges from one vertex to an other which is defined by weight.
In this project there are several implementations of algorithms which could be used on a directed weighted graph including the following algorithms :

•`shortest path : `which return the shortest path between a source vertex to a destination vertex.

•`connected components : `which return  all the strongly connected components (SCC) in the graph.

•`plot graph : `which shows a visual graph (all the nodes and all the edges that are there.

The implementation of the graph is using dictionary which representing the nodes and a list which represents the edges between the nodes and as well you can find there the following information : The source and the destination nodes and the weight between them which representing the weight of the edge 

For more information about the classes , you are wellcome to view the Wiki.
